This is a project from The Odin Project, where my assignment was to build a web page with a design provided by the course
(https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png).

The objective of this webpage is to create a layout so that anyone can put in their desired contents and use it to whatever they want.
